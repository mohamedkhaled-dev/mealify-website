# 🍽️ Mealify – Meal Delivery Service Website

Welcome to **Mealify**! This is my third project, a fully responsive meal delivery website with a sleek dark mode. I focused on building a simple yet engaging interface to make the user experience smooth and visually appealing.

## 🚀 New Features

- 📱 **Responsive Design:** The site is optimized for all devices, ensuring a seamless experience whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
- 🌙 **Dark Mode:** A stylish, user-friendly feature that enhances the viewing experience while providing an elegant, modern look.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **HTML**: For structuring the website and content.
- **CSS**: To add styling, create a responsive layout, and implement dark mode.

## 📌 Project Goals
This project was designed to demonstrate my skills in creating fully responsive web applications and integrating a smooth user interface. It was also an opportunity to experiment with **dark mode** and make the website more engaging.
